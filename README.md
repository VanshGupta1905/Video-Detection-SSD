## Key Features
### CenterNet Architecture: 
A state-of-the-art object detection model known for its efficiency and strong performance on various datasets.
SSD Optimization: Leverages the SSD algorithm to further improve detection speed without significant loss of accuracy.
Real-Time Performance: Processes video frames quickly to provide near-instantaneous object detection results.
TensorFlow/Keras: Uses popular deep learning frameworks for ease of development and deployment.
Customizable: Easily adapt the model to detect specific object classes relevant to your use case (e.g., vehicles, pedestrians, traffic signs).
Use Cases
Self-Driving Cars:
Detect and track objects in the environment to inform decision-making for autonomous navigation.
Surveillance Systems: 
Monitor areas for security threats or suspicious activities.
Robotics:
Enable robots to interact with and navigate through complex environments.
Industrial Automation: 
Identify and track objects on assembly lines or in manufacturing processes.


# Note
The project is designed to be modular and extensible.

Consider using a GPU for faster inference.

Experiment with different model architectures and parameters to find the best fit for your specific application.
