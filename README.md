Real-Time Object Detection for Video using CenterNet and SSD (TensorFlow/Keras)
This project implements real-time object detection for video streams using the CenterNet architecture with SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector) for enhanced speed and accuracy.  It's built on TensorFlow with Keras, making it easy to deploy and adapt for a variety of applications, including self-driving cars.

## Key Features
### CenterNet Architecture: 
A state-of-the-art object detection model known for its efficiency and strong performance on various datasets.
SSD Optimization: Leverages the SSD algorithm to further improve detection speed without significant loss of accuracy.
Real-Time Performance: Processes video frames quickly to provide near-instantaneous object detection results.
TensorFlow/Keras: Uses popular deep learning frameworks for ease of development and deployment.
Customizable: Easily adapt the model to detect specific object classes relevant to your use case (e.g., vehicles, pedestrians, traffic signs).
Use Cases
Self-Driving Cars:
Detect and track objects in the environment to inform decision-making for autonomous navigation.
Surveillance Systems: 
Monitor areas for security threats or suspicious activities.
Robotics:
Enable robots to interact with and navigate through complex environments.
Industrial Automation: 
Identify and track objects on assembly lines or in manufacturing processes.


# Note
The project is designed to be modular and extensible.
Consider using a GPU for faster inference.
Experiment with different model architectures and parameters to find the best fit for your specific application.
